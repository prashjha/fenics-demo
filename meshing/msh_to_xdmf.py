    Parameters
    ==========
    filename:
        The file name to read/write (not including extension). The extension ".msh" is
        appended to create the 'read from' file name, and the extension ".xdmf" is
        appended to create the 'write to' file name. If any mesh facets are marked as
        "Physical" regions, the suffix "_facets.xdmf" is appended to create the file
        name for exporting this information.
    prune:
        Force the geometric dimension to match the topological dimension of the mesh by
        removing geometry coordinates of higher dimension than the mesh topology (i.e.
        for 1D meshes, only the x-coordinate is retained, for 2D meshes only the
        x- and y-coordinates are retained, etc.)
